Our commitment to developing table tennis in Alkmaar’s schools is very important to the future growth, sustainability and longer term success of Ping Pong Alkmaar.

The benefits for school children playing regular table tennis are very clear and positive. Playing table tennis improves hand-eye coordination, balance and motoric movement. Table tennis increases levels of concentration, therefore physical and mentality it is a fantastic activity for the development of young people. Table tennis in a school setting also provides a welcome stress release for pupils in a relaxing social setting. Table tennis has a fun, social and relaxing function.

Our work in Alkmaar’s 50+ schools is ongoing every week of the year. We systematically visit all the primary schools with our own tables delivering clinics for all ages groups.

Starting in September 2020 we will be starting a primary school table tennis competition where pupils get to play matches against other local schools. This structured competition will lead to the winning school representing Alkmaar in the NTTB national primary schools tournament.

Our table tennis services to secondary schools is also increasingly popular across Alkmaar. We receive regular requests to deliver table tennis workshops/clinics in secondary schools and colleges.

Our regular clients include Clusius College, Willem Blaeu College, PCC College among others.
