Our junior sessions are inclusive sessions for youngsters of all levels. Sessions are structured to include ‘technical skills’ together with fun games to maximise the enjoyment and therefore improvement levels of our youngsters. Chinese training methods are used during the sessions including ‘multi-ball’ and ‘robot training’ to focus all players on physical and technical areas of the game.
